# AI Programming Foundations – Project 1

## Project Description
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow on a real-world marketing campaign performance dataset. The goal is to demonstrate reproducible data science practices, including data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

## What Was Built
- A Jupyter notebook implementing a full EDA workflow
- Reusable data cleaning and analysis functions
- Visualizations highlighting key marketing performance relationships
- A written academic summary following APA guidelines

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (optional) pip freeze > requirements.txt  (keep a safe snapshot of working environment)
3. Open and run (ex: using VS Code):
   data_workflow.ipynb

## Reproducibility Notes
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Git version control was used with multiple commits and branches to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
